### How to Play:

- Seers: At night, Seers can reveal a player's identity. If the Seer discovers an NPC who is an Assassin, they will vote to kick them out at dawn. Seers lose their memory when a new night begins.
- Villagers: Villagers have no special abilities at night but can vote to kick a player out at dawn.
- Assassins: Assassins vote at nightfall to eliminate a player and can see each other's identities.

### Game Cycle:

- Nightfall: Seers and Assassins actively use their abilities. Seers identify players, while Assassins collectively choose a target to eliminate.
- Dawn: All players, including Villagers, participate in a vote to kick out a suspected player.

### Winning Conditions:

- The game ends when either all Assassins are expelled (victory for Seers and Villagers) or Assassins outnumber the other roles.
